In this game, you jump over and duck under obstacles. 

The placement of these obstacles will be decided by the music you select. 

Press the right side of the screen to slide/duck and the left side of the screen to jump. 

Pressing the center of the screen will bring up the pause screen, which will allow you to change settings or quit the game.

These controls can be changed in the options menu.
