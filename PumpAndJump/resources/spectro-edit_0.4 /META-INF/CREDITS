Thanks to:

Thanks to Sun Microsystems for Java 5! Spectro-Edit is implemented
entirely in the Java programming language. Programming in Java is
better and more fun. So there. :P

Thanks to Piotr Wendykier of Emory University for his JTransforms
library, which Spectro-Edit uses for its fast and accurate DCT and
IDCT routines. JTransforms is available under a MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/
LGPL 2.1 tri-license. Spectro-Edit uses it under the terms of LGPL
2.1.

Thanks also to Mark James for his Silk icon set. Spectro-Edit uses
a mix of original and butchered (by me) icons from this set.
